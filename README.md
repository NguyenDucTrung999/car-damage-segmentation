# Car Damage Segmentation

This is my first university project as a first-year student at UWE Bristol - Phenikaa Campus. The project utilizes [YOLOv9](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov9) for detecting and segmenting car damage in images. As my initial attempt, it has some limitations, which I plan to address and improve in future iterations.

## Details
- **Technology**: [YOLOv9](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov9) (You Only Look Once, version 9), a state-of-the-art object detection and segmentation model.
- **Purpose**: To detect and segment car damage in images for automated damage assessment.
- **Results**:

## Future Plans
- Refactor and optimize the YOLOv9 model for improved performance.
- Address current limitations and fix bugs to enhance accuracy and reliability.
