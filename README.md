# Car Damage Segmentation

This is my first university project as a first-year student at UWE Bristol - Phenikaa Campus, developed using YOLOv9 for detecting and segmenting car damage. The project has several flaws, and I plan to revisit and improve it in the future.

## Details
- **Technology**: YOLOv9
- **Purpose**: Detect and segment car damage in images.
- **Results**:

## Future Plans
- Refactor and optimize the model.
- Address current limitations and bugs.
